# FORKED FROM: Imperial College - EEE - Human Centered Robotics 2024 -> 

This repo is used to test receiving motion commands from VR/tablet via ROS to a p3at robot. This repository acted as a replacement from [SPOT](https://github.com/HCR-Avatour/SPOT) repo, when SPOT was unavailable. 

# Prerequisites

## Theory
Some basic notions of Docker and ROS would be really helpful to get you started. You will learn more about those tools during the class, but you should try to get a basic understanding of the following notions before continuing:
- Linux
  - Environment variables

- Docker
  - Container
  - Image
  - Volumes
  - `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker exec` commands

- ROS
  - Workspace
  - Package
  - Node
  - Topic
  - `roscore`, `roslaunch`, `rosrun`

## Software
From a technical standpoint, you need to install the following on your (Linux) computer: [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

You also need to [know your IP](https://opensource.com/article/18/5/how-find-ip-address-linux).

Here is a short installation example on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install git -y
curl https://get.docker.com | sh && sudo systemctl --now enable docker
```

## Hardware
All P3-ATs have beem checked by the GTAs, so you robot should be working. All you need to do is:
 - **Make sure the batteries are charged** - check the 12V output on each battery
 - **Check that you are plugged in the right serial port** - the one near the motors, reset, etc buttons (see picture below)
 - Check that the other end of your serial to USB adaptor is **plugged in your computer**

# Getting started

> **NB**: since docker requires sudo access, you will have to use `sudo XXX` and enter your password quite often. If you want to avoid this, simply type `sudo usermod -aG docker [YOUR_USERNAME]`, and then reboot your computer. If you choose to do this, you can then replace `sudo make XXX` by `make XXX` in all the following.
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:ImperialCollegeLondon/hcr_docker.git

cd hcr_docker

# Create your own .env file based on the example
cp .env.example .env

##### IMPORTANT ######
# You need to edit .env and replace the default values with your setup: your IP...
vim .env
######################

# Build the Docker image containing the driver
sudo make build
```
Once the image is built, open a new terminal and start `roscore`.
Then, come back to the first terminal and run:
```bash
# Run the driver
sudo make run
```

If everything goes well, you should see something like:
```bash
[ INFO] [1638375581.966504576]: RosAria: set port: [/dev/ttyUSB0]

[ INFO] [1638375582.822727512]: rosaria: Setup complete
```

Once the driver is running, you can use ROS' default keyboard teleop to move the robot (in a new terminal):
```bash
# Install with `sudo apt install ros-noetic-teleop-twist-keyboard` if necessary
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/RosAria/cmd_vel
```
You are now ready to use the robot; check out [ROSARIA's documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROSARIA) to learn more about the different types of data you can access through topics.
